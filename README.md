## About Me
At Aernnova Aerospace, my focus as a Tooling Design Engineer since February 2024 has been to optimize solutions using advanced design tools, building on my studies in Industrial Engineering with a major in Mechanics from the European University and my background in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southampton. Prior to my current role, I gained experience in Data Analytics at Deloitte and Aerodynamic Engineering at Formula UEM, which has given me a practical and analytical perspective. I stand out for my problem solving skills and my ability to expose solutions, qualities that have allowed me to contribute significantly to the projects I have been involved in.
